## Overview

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation is built based on the Architecture Reference Framework and aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication, and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.
The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation is based on a modular architecture composed of business-agnostic, reusable components that will evolve in incremental steps and can be re-used across multiple projects.

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation is the application that allows users to:

1. To obtain, store, and, present PID and mDL.
2. Verify presentations.
3. Share data on proximity scenarios.
4. Support remote QES and more use cases with the modules included.

The EUDIW project provides through this repository an Android app. Please refer to the repositories listed in the following sections for more detailed information on how to get started, contribute, and engage with the EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation.
 
# ðŸ’¡ Specifications Employed

The app consumes the SDK called EUDIW Wallet core [Wallet core](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-lib-android-wallet-core) and a list of available libraries to facilitate remote presentation, proximity, and issuing test/demo functionality following specification of the [ARF](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework) including:
 
- OID4VP draft 19 (remote presentation), presentation exchange v2.0,
 
- ISO18013-5 (proximity presentation),
 
- OID4VCI draft 12 (issuing)
 
- Issuer functionality, to support development and testing, one can access an OID4VCI test/demo service for issuing at: 

  - ```https://issuer.eudiw.dev/oidc.```

  - [OpenID4VCI PID and mDL Issuer (python)](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-web-issuing-eudiw-py)
 
  - [OpenID4VCI PID and mDL Issuer (kotlin)](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-pid-issuer)
 
Relying Party functionality:
 
To support development and testing, one can access a test/demo service for remote presentation at:

  - https://verifier.eudiw.dev. 

  - [Web verifier source](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-web-verifier)

  - [Verifier restful backend service source](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-web-verifier-endpoint-23220-4-kt).
 
To support proximity an Android Proximity Verifier is available as an app that can request PID and mDL with reader authentication available [here](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/eu-digital-identity-wallet/apps/mdoc-verifier-testing/distribution_groups/eudi%20verifier%20(testing)%20public)

The issuer, verifier service, and verifier app authentication are based on the EUDIW development [IACA](https://github.com/niscy-eudiw/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui/tree/main/resources-logic/src/main/res/raw)

## Disclaimer

The released software is an initial development release version: 
-  The initial development release is an early endeavor reflecting the efforts of a short time-boxed period, and by no means can be considered as the final product.  
-  The initial development release may be changed substantially over time, might introduce new features but also may change or remove existing ones, potentially breaking compatibility with your existing code.
-  The initial development release is limited in functional scope.
-  The initial development release may contain errors or design flaws and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss.
-  The initial development release has reduced security, privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to future releases. This could make the software slower, less reliable, or more vulnerable to attacks than mature software.
-  The initial development release is not yet comprehensively documented. 
-  Users of the software must perform sufficient engineering and additional testing in order to properly evaluate their application and determine whether any of the open-sourced components is suitable for use in that application.
-  We strongly recommend not putting this version of the software into production use.
-  Only the latest version of the software will be supported

You will also need to download the Android Verifier app [here](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/eu-digital-identity-wallet/apps/mdoc-verifier-testing/distribution_groups/eudi%20verifier%20(testing)%20public)

App launch

1. Launch the application
2. You will be presented with a welcome screen where you will be asked to create a PIN for future logins.

Issuance flow

1. Then you will be shown the "Add document" screen.
